# üöó **Car Parking System** üöó

Welcome to the **Car Parking System** project! This system leverages embedded systems to automate and manage vehicle entry and exit in a parking lot. It utilizes sensors, a servo motor, and Bluetooth communication to create an intelligent and efficient parking management solution.

## üì¶ **Items Used** 

- **Tx (Transmitter)**: For wireless communication.
- **Rx (Receiver)**: To receive signals from the transmitter.
- **IR1 (PA0 - Entry Sensor)**: Infrared sensor for vehicle entry detection.
- **IR2 (PA1 - Exit Sensor)**: Infrared sensor for vehicle exit detection.
- **Servo Motor**: To control the parking barrier (open/close functionality).
- **Bluetooth Module (PA2, PA3)**: Used to control and monitor the system via Bluetooth-enabled devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hardware Connections** 

1. **IR Sensors**:
   - **IR1 (PA0)**: Detects vehicle entry.
   - **IR2 (PA1)**: Detects vehicle exit.

2. **Bluetooth Module**:
   - **TX Pin**: PA2
   - **RX Pin**: PA3

3. **Servo Motor**:
   - Connect the servo motor signal pin to an available GPIO pin.
   - VCC to power supply and ground to the common ground.

4. **Transmitter and Receiver**:
   - Used for additional communication functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works** 

1. **Vehicle Entry**: 
   - When a car approaches, the **IR1 sensor (PA0)** is activated, triggering the **servo motor** to open the parking gate. 
   - The system keeps track of available parking slots to avoid overflow.

2. **Vehicle Exit**:
   - When a vehicle exits, the **IR2 sensor (PA1)** is triggered, and the system closes the parking gate after the vehicle has left.
   
3. **Bluetooth Communication**:
   - The system can be monitored and controlled remotely via Bluetooth (PA2 and PA3).
   - **Bluetooth control** allows users to check parking slot availability or manually open/close the gate via their smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled devices.

## üíª **Software Overview** 

- The software runs on a microcontroller (e.g., STM32), handling:
  - **Sensor input**
  - **Motor control** 
  - **Bluetooth communication** 

- The microcontroller uses **UART** for communication with the Bluetooth module.
- The system includes logic to handle vehicle entry/exit, ensuring the servo motor operates only when the corresponding sensor is triggered.
